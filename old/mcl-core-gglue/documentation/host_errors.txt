This document describes possible errors in the host API that MCL
should be able to deal with.

1) multiply defined expectation groups
   why? because expectation groups are not deleted immediately
   the host might execute dissolve and declare with the same action
   without monitoring in between.

   it is fair for the host to do this and so some checking must go on
   to reconcile the multiply defined expectation group.
