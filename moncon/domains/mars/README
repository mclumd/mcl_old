HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE MARS SIMULATOR
------------------------------------------

STEP 1 - BUILD (linux instructions)
=======================================

Ensure you have g++ and make installed.

Get, and "make install" umbc_utils and mcl_2_0.

Ensure that /usr/local/lib/ is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Make the moncon substrate by running "make" in the moncon directory.

Make the mars_main executable by running "make" in the
moncon/domains/mars directory.

STEP 2 - CONFIGURE (linux instructions)
=======================================

There are several files that you will want/need to have in place in
order to run the Mars simulator in configurations other than the
default.

All files described here are flat text unless otherwise noted.

 SETTINGS FILES....
 see umbc_utils/docs/guide.pdf for more information on settings files.
 NOTE that all settings set in files will be overridden by the command line.
 NOTE that you should just copy the sample settings files to the approp

 ~/.umbcutil_settings
 this is the settings file for umbc utils.
 sample settings in umbc_utils/assets/settings.tet can be copied 
 to ~/.umbcutil_settings

 ~/.mcl_settings
 settings file for MCL. if you will not be using MCL, this is optional.
 the setting "mcl.reply=prolog" is required for use with ALFRED.
 allows you to set up default directories, etc. for MCL.
 sample settings in mcl_2_0/assets/settings.tet
 
 ~/.mars_settings
 settings file for Mars/Moncon. mostly configuration and output options.
 sample settings in moncon/domains/mars/assets/settings.tet

 TIMELINES....
 timelines will allow you to schedule events
 and goals in the simulation. 
 sample timeline in moncon/domains/mars/assets/mars_sample.tl

 CONFIG FILES....
 config files define the agents and controllers used in the
 simulation.  note that in moncon/domains/mars/assets, there are
 several configuration files (they end in *.mars). these files can be
 used by mars_main either by specifying them in settings files or in
 the command line:

 ./mars_main --mars.config assets/tcp_config.mars

 and the config files can also override stuff in the settings file
 through use of the "set" config command. set commands will even
 override the command line.
 
STEP 3 - RUN (linux instructions)
=======================================

after setting up the necessary configuration, you should be able to
run using

./mars_main

note that any setting that occurs in a settings file can be specified
from the command line by preceeding the keyword with two dashes:

./mars_main --mars.logfile alfredlog.html
