Some notes from a 2008-9-11 email from Matt on installing MCL and the MonCon simulator:

Mcl

   1. set the environment variable MCL_CORE_PATH to point to MCL's directory
      MCL_CORE_PATH=/fs/metacog/group/mcl/mcl-core-gglue/
      this will allow the MCL library to find default configuration files
   2. mcl builds to a library, found at /fs/metacog/group/mcl/mcl-core-gglue/libMCL2core.so
   3. running "make" in the mcl-core-gglue directory builds this library

MonCon/Mars

   1. running "make" in the /fs/metacog/group/mcl/moncon directory will build two libraries
      the moncon_substrate.so library, which provides a simulator substrate
      the moncon_utils.so library, which contains some general-purpose utilities
   2. the mars simulation is build on the substrate, and can be found in moncon/domains/mars
   3. running "make" in moncon/domains/mars will build the default application mars_main
   4. mars_main will read a file .mc_config from the cwd to set up the simulation
      it is a plain text file with agent, controller, and basic parameter definitions
      by default, it creates 2 rovers with planner controllers, a relay station, and a tcp dispatcher
   5. mars_main can take -- arguments to change parameters:
          * --port <port> to change tcp port; default is 8400
          * --timeline <tl_file> to load a timeline (see mars_sample.tl for example)
   6. once the simulator is brought up, you can connect to it using telnet
      telnet localhost 8400
   7. type "grammar" into telnet for possible commands
